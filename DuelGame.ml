(*A game to be played between two or more people. Each character has a weapon, armor, and class associated with it. To play aggame, each person creates a player for themselves and that is stored into a tuple that holds the name of the player and his/her stats. The function FightDuel initiates a battle between two players. The players can choose one of three moves for that battle: Attack, Block, and Heal. Attack decreases the other player's health by an amount specified by his/her attack stat. Block decreases the amount the other player's attack affects him/her and also increases his/her attack stat. Heal increases his/her health. The player that reach 0 health loses and the player last standing wins. However, if both/all players reach 0 health after one round, then everyone loses.

    EXAMPLE:
    val asher = makePlayer("Asher the Great",Greatsword, Leather, Assassin);
    val tim = makePlayer("Tim the Humble",Shield, Iron, Monk);
    FightDuel(asher, Attack, tim, Block);
